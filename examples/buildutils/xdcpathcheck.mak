#  ======== xdcpathcheck.mak ========
#  This file checks various paths set in xdcpaths.mak for their correctness
#  Also complains if required toolchains are not set by the user.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Most users have no need to modify anything in this file

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If we're a subcomponent, allow larger product settings to override our
# defaults.  The variable $(RULES_MAKE) can be overridden on the 'make'
# command-line if the location below is not correct (for example, if you
# want to use a Rules.make from some other location.
RULES_MAKE := $(CE_INSTALL_DIR)/../Rules.make
ifneq ($(wildcard $(RULES_MAKE)),)
include $(RULES_MAKE)
endif

# Note, some good defensive programming here could be to ensure $(DEVICES) and
# $(PROGRAMS) - and others! - don't contain any space characters

#
# Set XDCARGS to some of the variables above.  xdcrules.mak will pass this
# variable to the XDC build engine... which will load config.bld... which will
# extract these variables and use them to determine what to build and which
# toolchains to use.
#
# Note that not all of these variables need to be set to something valid.
# Unfortunately, since these vars are unconditionally assigned, your build line
# will be longer and more noisy than necessary (e.g., it will include CC_V5T
# assignment even if you're just building for WinCE.  While benign, it is
# annoying.  In future releases, we'll clean up this XDCARGS assignment and
# only include the vars that are required.
