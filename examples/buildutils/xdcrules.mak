# If not set in the environment, set XDCOPTIONS to verbose (the 'v' option)
XDCOPTIONS ?= v

# JOBS is the max number of parallel build commands to run concurrently.
# You can often get a build performance lift by setting JOBS to a value > 1,
# however debugging build errors is tough(!), so the default setting is 1.
JOBS ?= 1

# Most examples use this, but allow overriding of this var for some
# examples with their own .bld file (e.g. servers which require
# their own memory maps)
XDCBUILDCFG ?= $(CE_INSTALL_DIR)/codec_engine.bld

# This command actually performs the build.
#
# Note that the "-PD ." says "build the package in this directory ("-P ."),
# and all of the packages it depends on ("-D").
#
# Note that $(XDCARGS) is set in xdcpaths.mak
#
# Note also that we explicitly set XDCBUILDCFG to the one in
# examples/_config.bld so we don't inadvertantly pick up any other config.bld
# found along XDCPATH.
